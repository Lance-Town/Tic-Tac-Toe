# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe implemented in Python. I wanted to write this script to get more familiar with Python and to test out Numpy arrays, and this felt like a fun project
to do that with.

I learned how to use Numpy arrays, and also became more familiar with traversing a 2-D array in different ways other than I normally would, in particular
traversing the 2-D array diagonally which was fun.
